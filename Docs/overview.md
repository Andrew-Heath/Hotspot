#HotSpot#
##Tremendous Thumb##
<br>
##Introduction##
###Situation###
> When a person wants to find a location to do X, they typically use multiple apps (ie. Yelp) and google searches to find what they need.

###Complication###
>This delays decision making and results in unnecessary frustration with the applications and people around them.


###Resolution###

>Develop an application that integrates features from applications that provide location information to create a custom map.

<em> “ One-click solution for personalized results. “ </em>

##Objective##
###In-Scope Bare Minimum###
  * Custom maps
  * Restaurants
  * Personalized Ratings
  * Leveraging APIs
  * Web-First

###In-Scope Future###
  * Machine learning for food recommendations
  * Friending features
  * Routing and directions (going on a date and going to a movie)
  * Additional categories / activities (bars, movies, outdoor locations, etc)
  * Mobile

###Out-of-Scope###
  * Ordering and purchasing anything
  * Relationships between user geolocation data
  * Writing machine algorithms
  * Creating maps

##Deliverables##
###Bare Minimum Requirements###
> To be delivered before Legacy hand-off

**Set Up**
  * Design
    * Select Technology
  * Google Maps API
  * Git Workflow
  * Role and Responsibilities
  * Timeline
    * Bare minimums
    * Testing – do later
  * Meeting schedule for solo week
  * Documentation
    * Code based
    * Code review
    * Additional

**Personal Features**
  * 1st Priority
    * Mark location through a simple search and let user save it
    * Rating – 2 ratings (would you come back)
    * Display marked locations on map
  * 2nd Priority
    * Filter on map by rating
    * Allow user to click to save
    * Current location
    * Allow user to save locations based on current location
    * Display collection of restaurants that are marked locations
    * Filter on display cards by rating
    * Save to home screen
    * Google API – search location and position it on the map

###Future Iterations###
> To be completed, time permitting

  * Continue Building Personal Features
    * Filter by type, friends, etc
    * Personal notes on locations
  * Add Group and Friend Features
    * Add friends
    * See marked locations from friends (filter by friends)
    * Combine locations onto one map
    * +1’s
    * Reviews
  * Add Suggestions and Machine Learning
    * Filter by suggestions

###Potential Roadblocks###
* Integrating mapping with framework
* Integrating location (i.e. Yelp photos) data with mapping data
* Overlaying information and functionality.

###Technical Investigations###
* React/Redux framework
* Mapping functionality availability
* Data available on locations from public APIs
* How to handle authentication

# HotSpot #

## by Tremendous Thumb Engineering ##

## Market ##
  > For those hungry and on-the-go - we don't have time to think about these things.


## Summary ##
  > HotSpot gives users the power to store all of their favorite locations in the way they've always wanted. With a few simple clicks, new restaurant and other location information is stored and readily available so that you can experience your favorite places over and over.

## Problem ##
> When a person wants to find a location to do X, they typically use multiple apps (ie. Yelp) and google searches to find what they need.

>This delays decision making and results in unnecessary frustration with the applications and people around them.

## Solution ##
> HotSpot gives you the power to have insanely fast access to your favorite locations.

## Quote from You ##
  > "A one-click solution for deciding where to go"

## How to Get Started ##
  > It's very easy to get started. Just start saving locations. Every time you forget about that cool new restaurant or at a loss for where to go, pull up the app and enjoy a life of easy decision making.
